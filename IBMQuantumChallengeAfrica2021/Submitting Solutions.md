# Submitting Solutions

If you wish to explore or develop the challenge notebooks further, we encourage everyone to share your solutionsÂ so that others can learn from you!

**How to Submit Solutions:**
1. Start with a clean notebook with only your own code. You may include the setup code from the lab notebooks.
2. Please make sure to include necessary import statements. Your notebook should run and obtain the result without need of modification.
3. Write detailed explanations of each step and how you arrived to this solution.
4. Make a pull request to the [challenge github repo](https://ibm.co/Africa_Github).
5. Please include your name, lab and exercise numbers, and score (if applicable) in the pull request.
6. Read [here](https://guides.github.com/activities/hello-world/#pr) to learn how to make a pull request if you are unfamiliar with GitHub.
