# Slack Details & Guidelines

Join the dedicated Slack channel **[#challenge-africa-2021](https://ibm.co/Africa_Slack)** where you can connect with mentors and fellow attendees! *(Join the [Qiskit Slack here](https://ibm.co/joinqiskitslack) if you haven't already.)*

## Mentor Assistance
Please make sure you check the pinned items in this channel for any FAQ's that may have already been asked. If you have any Lab related questions, please tag **@africa_mentor** for assistance from our wonderful team of mentors! Please keep your questions in the channel and **do not message content creators or mentors directly**, unless they've given you specific permission to do so. By keeping questions in the channel, you can help everyone out!Â 


## Hints & Solutions
We want everyone to enjoy and challenge themselves when working on the exercises and labs. In order to do so, we need to preserve the lab work and solutions. **Please do not share out detailed hints or any type of solutions for the challenge.** Our mentors are here to help for this reason, so if you see a fellow attendee in need of assistance, please guide them toward our mentor team.


## Code of Conduct 
The IBM Quantum Challenge Africa 2021 and the Qiskit Community team are committed to maintaining the highest level of enjoyment, accessibility, and inclusivity by maintaining an environment of respect, empathy, and compassion for others. In order to support that, we ask that each participant review the Qiskit Community Code of Conduct before the event, and be familiar with our community standards to join us in maintaining a safe and welcoming event for all.
