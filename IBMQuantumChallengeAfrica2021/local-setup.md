# Setting up your environment locally

If you are struggling to use the IBM Quantum platform for the challenge, you can run the notebooks locally. For a guide on setting up Jupyter and Python on your machine, follow the [Python and Jupyter guide](https://qiskit.org/textbook/ch-prerequisites/python-and-jupyter-notebooks.html) from the Qiskit documentation.

To download the notebooks, you can clone this repo to your local machine. To install the necessary dependencies, you should run the following command in this repo directory:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Make sure to follow the installation guidelines for the grading client [here](https://github.com/qiskit-community/Quantum-Challenge-Grader).
