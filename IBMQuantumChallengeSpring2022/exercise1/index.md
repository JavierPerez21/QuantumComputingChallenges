How is studying electrons within a material similar to a cup of coffee going cold? How can a system have a 'memory' of its original state, even after its changed multiple times? The dynamics within what we refer to as Many-Body Systems helps us understand all of this, and more. Exercise 1, 2, and 3 are all part of the same storyline that explores these questions through the lens of a quantum computer.

In exercise 1 we begin to understand how overlaps in the particle wavefunction with multiple lattice sites allow for particle transport within a tight-binding model. We also observe how the time needed for this to happen can change dramatically compared to classical transport. To execute this investigation on a quantum computer, we must decompose our math into a product of single and two-qubit gates that are native to the quantum computer. You will use a method called trotterization to simulate the dynamics of a particle in the tight-binding system.
