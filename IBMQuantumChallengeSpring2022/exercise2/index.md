In a tight-binding system the particle propagation can be described by a continuous-time quantum random walk. Quantum random walks are the quantum mechanical analog of classical random walks. Quantum properties such as single-particle superposition and interference result in a qualitative difference between classical and quantum random walks. Therefore, quantum walks are quadraticaly faster than classical walks, which is analogous to the quadratic speed-up of the Grover search algorithm compared to classical search. 

However, particle propagation is significantly impacted by the introduction of disorder in the site energies, leading to Anderson localization. Lattice inhomogeneity causes scattering and leads to quantum interference that tends to inhibit particle propagation, a signature of localization. The wavefunction of a localized particle rapidly decays away from its initial position, effectively confining the particle to a small region of the lattice.
