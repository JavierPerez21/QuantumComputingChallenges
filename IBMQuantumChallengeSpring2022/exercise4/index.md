title: Exercise 4
subtitle: Using VQE On a Water Molecule
parts: 4a,4b
---

In Challenge 4 we will shift our gaze over to analyzing fermionic systems - like water! You will be using a well-known algorithm called the Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE) to attempt to find the ground state energy (lowest energy) of a water molecule. VQE has multiple aspects you need to understand, like how to define our problem with Qiskit Nature, how to select the most efficient ansatz, and how to use the ground state results to perform excited states calculations.

Throughout this challenge you will learn how to extend the ground state calculation to find the electronic transition energies of this water molecule, and then compare the quantum algorithm results with those obtained classically. This approach and type of comparative analysis is the same type of research being done in labs across the world today. You're following in the footsteps of scientists who have published their research in Nature and beyond. Good luck!
