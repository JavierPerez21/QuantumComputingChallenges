title: Challenge 2
subtitle: Qiskit Nature - Band gap calculation of OLED molecules
parts: 2a,2b,2c,2d,2e,2f
---

Quantum computers can be used for studying the electronic structure and dynamic properties of complex molecules and materials. With this challenge, you will use Qiskit to describe quantum computations of the “excited states” or high energy states, of industrial chemical compounds that could potentially be used in the fabrication of efficient organic light emitting diode (OLED) devices.

**Problem:** Define target molecules as an eletronic structure problem and apply quantum algorithms to estimate the correct bandgap between reduced molecular orbitals.

**Level:** Foundational
