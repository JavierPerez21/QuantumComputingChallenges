Machine learning is a technology that has attracted a significant amount of attention due to its high performance and versatility, and quantum computation has the potential to further enhance it. In this challenge, you will implement image classification models using one of the methods of quantum machine learning; Quantum Support Vector Machine (QSVM).

**Problem:** Implement 3-class image classifier with QSVM and achieve better accuracy with smaller feature map circuits.

**Level:** Intermediate
