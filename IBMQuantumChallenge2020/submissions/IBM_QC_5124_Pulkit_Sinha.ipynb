    "1.  We prove the first statement using Hall's Marriage Theorem.\n",
    "\n",
    "    It can be clearly seen that if there are 4 asteroids in a permutation matrix configuration, then the board is not solvable by just 3 beams.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Now we prove the other implication. Suppose the board is not solvable by just 3 beams.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Then, consider consider the set of rows and columns of the boards as vertices, and consider every asteroid as an edge between the row and column it belongs to.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Clearly, the graph formed is a bipartite graph.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Now, we prove that in this graph obtained, every set of $k$ columns is directly connected to atleast $k$ rows, for every $k\\in\\{1,2,3,4\\}$. \n",
    "\n",
    "    Suppose otherwise. Then, for some board unclearable by just 3 beams, there is some set of $k$ columns that are directly connected to atmost $k-1$ rows. This means, that for those $k$ columns, $k-1$ horizontal beams ($1$ through each of the $k-1$ rows) can destroy all the asteroids contained in these $k$ columns. Now, for the rest of the asteroids, one can fire $4-k$ vertical beams (one through each of the remaining columns) to clear the rest of the rest of the asteroids. \n",
    "\n",
    "    Thus, with only $(4-k)+(k-1)=3$ beams, one can clear out all the asteroids, which is a contradiction.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Thus, for every board not clearable by $3$ beams, in the corresponding graph,  every set of $k$ columns is directly connected to atleast $k$ rows, for every $k\\in\\{1,2,3,4\\}$. \n",
    "\n",
    "    Now, with this, Hall's Marriage Theorem implies the existence of a perfect bipartite matching between the set of rows and columns. Now, in this matching, there are $4$ edges, and every edge corresponds to an asteroid, and among these, no two share a same row or a column, as it is a perfect matching. But this is exactly a permutation matrix. Thus, for every board unsolvable by 3 beams, the board contains 4 asteroids in a permutation matrix configuration.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Thus, we have proved the first statement. Note that this statement generalises readily to $N\\times N$ boards (and $N-1$ beams). In fact, it can be shown that Hall's Marriage theorem can be derived from the general result.\n",
    "\n",
    "2.  Now, we prove the second statement.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Suppose there is a board with atmost $6$ asteroids, and there are atleast $2$ distict choices of $4$ asteroids which form a permutation matrix. We prove that there are no more.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Let us denote one of the permuation matrices by $P_1$\n",
    "    \n",
    "    Let the board be represented by the $4\\times 4$ matrix $A=P_1+B$, where  $B$ is a matrix with $6-4=2$ cells $1$, and all others $0$, and it does not share any have any $1$ in the same position as that in $P_1$. (The $1$'s in $A$ denote the presence of an asteroid in that position).\n",
    "\n",
    "    Since there are are more than one permuation matrices in $A$, consider another permuation matrix $P_2\\ne P_1$ contained inside $A$. \n",
    "    \n",
    "    Now, clearly, if we fix $3$ positions of $1$'s of any permutation matrix, the final position is uniquely determined, as one just considers the element in the uncovered row and column.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    Thus, for any two distinct permuation matrices, one contains $1$'s in atleast two cells where the other does not, and vice versa. Thus, $P_2$ must contain btoh the  $1$'s from $B$. Now, there can only be 2 $1$'s in $P_1$ which do not share any row or column with any of the $1$'s in $B$, as each $1$ in $P_1$ has a distinct row and colum. \n",
    " \n",
    "     Now, since we need atleast $2$ more $1$'s to form any permuation matrix containing $B$, since $A=P_1+B$, there atmost one way of forming a permuation matrix $P_2$ containing $B$.\n",
    "     \n",
    "     Hence, given $P_1$, if $P_2$ exists, then it is unique. Thus, there can only be atmost $2$ permuation matrix configurations formed by the asteroids on the board."

    "# QRAM Implementation:\n",
    " We use 4 qubits to store the address, and 3 extra work qubits. Also, we use RCCX gates instead of CCX or MCT's in order to keep the costs low. We can do this as we will be appending QRAM$^{-1}$ after the computation.\n",

RCCX gate is not symmetric wrt control gates, and when one applies rccx($a,b,t$) and rccx($c,b,t$) without any additional gate applied on $b$ and $t$ between these two applications of rccx, then 2 cx gates and 3 u3 gates cancel out. This is true even when $a$ and $c$ denote the same qubit and there are some gates applied on that qubit between the application of the rccx's. So, we define two new gates which would replace rccx gates under the given conditions. We call these fhrccx and shrccx( more details about these in the definition in the code). Note: we had to flip some rccx(a,b,c)'s to rccx(b,a,c)'s (i.e, interchanged the control qubtis) for this cancellation to take place. This is okay as anyways we were using the RCCX gate as an alternative to CCX.\n",
