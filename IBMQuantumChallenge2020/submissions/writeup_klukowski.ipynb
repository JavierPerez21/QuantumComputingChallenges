    "# Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "### Abstract\n",
    "\n",
    "This is a solution for final problem from Autumn 2020 IBM Quantum Challenge. It uses the permutation approach, giving the circuit cost equal 6409. The main idea is to use an oracle with phase factor of $e^\\frac{2 \\pi i}{3}$ instead of $-1$ as in standard Grover's algorithm.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you have any comments/questions, do not hesitate to contact me on qiskit Slack (adam klukowski) or at ak2028@cam.ac.uk.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Problem statement\n",
    "\n",
    "We are given 16 boards of dimensions 4x4 with six asteroids on each. Using a laser beam we can remove all asteroids on a chosen row/column. The task is to find the unique board that cannot be cleaned with at most three laser shots (it is allowed to use vertical and horizontal beams at the same time). We are asked to use Grover's algorithm with one iteration.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Approach overview and motivation\n",
    "\n",
    "Our circuit will use straightforward architecture:\n",
    " - Hadamard gates, to create equal superposition of address qubits\n",
    " - qRAM, to entangle address qubits with data qubits\n",
    " - oracle acting on data qubits\n",
    " - uncomputing qRAM\n",
    " - diffuser acting on address qubits\n",
    "\n",
    "The oracle uses the following fact: a board is unsolvable iff it contains four asteroids with no two on the same row or column (a permutation matrix). Finding such arrangement can be thought of as a **dual problem** - each laser beam can eliminate at most one asteroid from such collection, so it is a \"certificate\" that we need at least four shots.\n",
    "\n",
    "Naive way would be to iterate over all 24 permutations and apply CCCZ to each. This does not work - we may encounter a board with exactly two permutations, and two phase factors would cancel. Instead, we will use controlled rotation by $\\frac{2\\pi}{3}$; this way unsolvable boards will acquire phase factor of $\\omega$ or $\\omega^2$, where $\\omega$ is primitive third root of unity.\n",
    "\n",
    "The idea for qRAM is inspired by linear algebra over field of two elements. The circuit consists of a part that looks like a map from address states to basis of $\\mathbb{Z}_2^{16}$, and another part that resembles a linear map.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Impact of a different phase factor\n",
    "\n",
    "It is natural to ask if full Grover's algorithm, beyond single iteration, is still possible with such oracle. It turns out that single oracle is not enough - one can obtain some aplification, but the amplitude will be bounded away from 1 (e.g. when searching among 1024 elements, the highest achievable probability of measuring the correct one is about 1%). However, we can overcome this by alternating between using phase factors $\\omega = e^\\frac{2 \\pi i}{3}$ and $\\omega^2 = e^\\frac{-2 \\pi i}{3}$. This comes at a cost: the rotation angle is smaller, so we need to apply a bit more iterations (still $O(\\sqrt{size})$, but with a bigger constant)."

However, in reality the second function is not linear, it only pretends to be.\n",
