## QHack QML Challenges

Sharpen your quantum machine learning (QML) skills and compete against other teams for top spot! 

The QML Challenge contains 12 individual problems, ranging in difficulty from building basic 
quantum circuits to implementing QML workflows. The problems can be tackled in any order, 
and harder questions are worth more points. The problems can be tackled individually or 
as part of a team (limit of one account per team).

The QML Challenges will remain open during the [QHack Open Hackathon](Open_Hackathon.md). Achieving a high rank on the [QML Challenge Scoreboard](https://challenge.qhack.ai/public) will improve your chances of claiming the Open Hackathon Grand Prize of summer internships at CERN.

### Power Ups

You can tackle the QML Challenges at any time during QHack, but there are some *Power Ups* available
to be won by those who start early. 

**The top 80 teams on the scoreboard at 6PM EST on Friday Feb 19 will receive $250 in AWS credits**. 

These credits can be used to build your [QHack Open Hackathon](Open_Hackathon.md) project. Teams can apply credits to any AWS service, including [Amazon Braket](https://aws.amazon.com/braket/), where they can showcase their ideas using Rigetti, IonQ, and D-Wave hardware or with high-performance simulators in the cloud.

### How do I take part?

You will need to register your Team in order to be able to submit your solutions and claim your points. There can only be one account associated with each Team, so if you're a Team of more than one person you should designate someone as Team Captain to register on behalf of the Team and submit the Team's solutions. 

To register, go to https://challenge.qhack.ai/register and enter the following:  

1. `Team name` - The name of your Team as it will appear on the Scoreboard.  
2. `Email address` - The email address associated with the account.  
3. `Username` - The login name for your account. You will use this login name to access your Team page.  
4. `Password` - The password for accessing your account.  
5. `Repeat Password` - Re-enter your password.
